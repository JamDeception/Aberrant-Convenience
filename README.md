# Aberrant-Convenience
Source code for my submission to Acerola Jam 0

Have you ever wanted a glimpse into the future? Now you can experience a part of that with a working prototype for retail built around a stress-free system. Customers must order online, and our assigned worker will handle your order in the nearest facility. Sure, it has a few kinks here and there. But we're certain that technology-integrated retail is going to be part of the future. There is a manual In the backroom although it isn't much use in this build of the game.

This game was made for Acerola Jam 0 and is a small, unfinished demo. I wish I had spent more time on this project although unfortunately, I got ill during the beginning and end of this project so there's a lot left to be desired. Let me know if there are any bugs and I might post an update sometime in the future!

How To Play:

Orders:

When an order appears on the screen, you can get products off the shelf and throw them into the basket (left click to pick up and throw items). Make sure they're correct!

Aberrations:

On occasions, this store can "glitch out" and unexpected things may arise. A similar thing can happen when an order is done to an unsatisfactory standard. So just in case,  make sure you have a flashlight with you.
